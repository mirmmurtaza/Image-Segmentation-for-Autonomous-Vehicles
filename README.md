# Image Segmentation for Autonomous Vehicles
This project focuses on the application of deep learning for image segmentation in autonomous vehicles. The project uses Python, NumPy, and TensorFlow for implementation. The main objective is to detect objects in street-traffic images and create segmented images.

The project implements two models for object detection - the U-NET model and the CANET model. The segmented images and corresponding JSON label files were created using the Python Imaging Library (PIL) by drawing polygons around the objects.

The results show that the U-NET model achieved an Intersection Over Union (IOU) score of 54%, while the CANET model achieved an IOU score of 19%. The project demonstrates the potential of deep learning for solving real-world problems in the field of computer vision and autonomous vehicles.
